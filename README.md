# Smeagol

In the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Smeagol is the nicer, hobbit name for Gollum, a creature who is infatuated by the ring of power. The motivation behind this framework is AV Evasion. Oftentimes C2 frameworks in red team engagements become next to useless when AVs like windows defender are consistently able to detect the agents. Smeagol aims to solve this problem by putting the agent development in the hands of red teams. An easily accessable api will be provided that agents can be quickly built on. Finally, in the light of defense evasion, many types of communication channels will be provided as well.
