# Smeagol

In the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Smeagol is the nicer, hobbit name for Gollum, a creature who is infatuated by the one ring. In the story, Smeagol betrays Frodo and attempts to steal the ring. This repository is focused on creating a Command and Control server for red team engagements focused on evading Anti Virus and thus surprising the blue team. A common problem with common C2 frameworks, is that they have set clients that are quickly identified by AV. This repository only provides documented apis so that red teamers can develop they're own clients in order to bypass AV.
